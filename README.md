##  Overview
**Stochastic Signal Analyzer** is a full-stack engineering project designed to simulate, visualize, and analyze noisy time-series data. 

This application generates synthetic signals (sinusoidal waves affected by Gaussian noise) to mimic real-world sensor data. It leverages **Generative AI (Google Gemini)** to act as an automated "Lab Assistant," performing real-time anomaly detection and signal integrity analysis on the stochastic datasets.

##  Key Features
* ** Signal Simulation Engine:** A Node.js backend that generates time-series data using the formula $S(t) = A \sin(\omega t) + \xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$ represents random stochastic noise.
* ** AI-Driven Inspection:** Integrates **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** to interpret numerical arrays, detecting anomalies (spikes, drops) and calculating signal confidence levels.
* ** Real-Time Visualization:** Uses `Recharts` to render dynamic data plots on a React-based frontend.
* ** Secure & Flexible:** Implements client-side API key management (BYOK) and supports **JSON file uploads** for external data analysis.
* ** Dockerized:** Fully containerized with Docker Compose for consistent deployment across any environment.
